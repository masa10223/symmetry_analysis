## What this repository is
This repository provides GUI-operated software that can automatically extract expression regions by scrolling or typing in threshold values.


## How to use 
```
git clone https://github.com/masa10223/symmetry_analysis
cd scripts
pip install requirements.yml
python Extract_Embryo_GUI.py
```
You can then scroll or type in the threshold values from the image in the GUI screen to automatically extract the expression area.
